"birth_date" and "hire_date" columns in table "employees" should be DATE datatype columns but I was having issues with setting up date format for the columns and thus the data load was failing. Therefore, I have setup these columns as VARCHAR for the sake of this assignment. However, my queries will reflect proper date filters in the WHERE clause.
